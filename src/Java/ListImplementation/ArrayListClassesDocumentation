ArrayList → backed by a resizable array (fast random access).
LinkedList → backed by singly linked nodes (good for sequential access, frequent inserts/deletes).
Doubly LinkedList → enhanced linked list with prev & next (bidirectional operations).

But in Java’s Collections Framework, there are a few more important List-related classes/interfaces you might still want to touch:

Vector

Legacy class (synchronized version of ArrayList).

Rarely used now, replaced by ArrayList + Collections.synchronizedList().

Stack (extends Vector)

Legacy stack implementation (LIFO).

Now we prefer Deque (ArrayDeque) for stack-like operations.

CopyOnWriteArrayList (from java.util.concurrent)

Thread-safe version of ArrayList.

Used in multi-threaded environments where reads are frequent and writes are rare.

 So, if you’re preparing for interviews:

Cover ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack, CopyOnWriteArrayList under List Implementations.

Also know Set implementations (HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet) and Map implementations (HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, Hashtable).
