With relational databases, the information you want is often stored in several tables.
 In such scenarios, you’ll need to join these tables.
 This is where the JOIN comes into play.
 The JOIN clause in SQL is used to combine rows from several tables based on a related column between these tables.



JOINS: INNER JOIN(JOIN),LEFT JOIN,RIGHT JOIN,FULL JOIN

-- ===========================
-- SQL JOINs – Quick Reference
-- ===========================

-- 1. INNER JOIN (JOIN)
-- Returns only matched records from both tables
SELECT b.id, b.title, a.first_name, a.last_name
FROM books b
INNER JOIN authors a ON b.author_id = a.id;

-- 2. LEFT JOIN
-- Returns all rows from left table, matched rows from right table
-- Unmatched rows from right → NULL
SELECT b.id, b.title, t.last_name AS translator
FROM books b
LEFT JOIN translators t ON b.translator_id = t.id;

-- 3. RIGHT JOIN
-- Returns all rows from right table, matched rows from left table
-- Unmatched rows from left → NULL
SELECT b.id, b.title, e.last_name AS editor
FROM books b
RIGHT JOIN editors e ON b.editor_id = e.id;

-- 4. FULL JOIN
-- Returns all rows from both tables
-- Unmatched rows on either side → NULL
SELECT b.id, b.title, e.last_name AS editor
FROM books b
FULL JOIN editors e ON b.editor_id = e.id;

-- ===========================
-- SUMMARY
-- INNER JOIN → only matches
-- LEFT JOIN  → all left + matches
-- RIGHT JOIN → all right + matches
-- FULL JOIN  → all rows (both sides)
